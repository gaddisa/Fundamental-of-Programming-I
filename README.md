C++ Tutorial Samples
This repository contains C++ sample codes that I adopted from various sources to help instruct programming in C++ in 2005. These samples try to help newcomers quickly find an appropriate pattern for solving their programming problems. Also they can quickly find out how a certain language construct, or a popular function is generally used.

These samples are by no means complete, nor free from deficiencies. Feel free to make them complete or introduce them to more C++ newbies or teachers. The samples cover only the standard/ISO C++ language.
