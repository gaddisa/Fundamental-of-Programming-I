# Fundamental-of-Programming-I
## C++ exercise solution for begginers
This repository contains C++ sample codes that I used to teach Fundamentals of Programming Course at Dire Dawa University, Ethiopia. These samples try to help newcomers quickly find an appropriate pattern for solving their programming problems. Also they can quickly find out how a certain language construct, or a popular function is generally used.

These samples are by no means complete, nor free from deficiencies. Feel free to make them complete or introduce them to more C++ newbies or teachers. The samples cover only the standard/ISO C++ language.

Thanks!
